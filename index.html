        <img src="Images\JoJo.jpg" alt="Image of all JoJo's" />
        <figcaption>
          JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (Japanese: ジョジョの奇妙な冒険, Hepburn:
          JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken) The universe of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a
          reflection of the real world with the added existence of supernatural
          forces and beings. In this setting, some people are capable of
          transforming their inner spiritual power into a Stand (スタンド,
          Sutando); another significant form of energy is Hamon (波紋,
          "Ripple"), a martial arts technique that allows its user to focus
          bodily energy into sunlight via controlled breathing.

        <figcaption>
          Haikyu!! (Japanese: ハイキュー!!, Haikyū!!, from the kanji 排球
          "volleyball") Hinata Shouyou, a short middle school student, gained a
          sudden love of volleyball after watching a national championship match
          on TV. Determined to become like the championship's star player, a
          short boy nicknamed "the small giant", Shouyou joined his school's
          volleyball club. Haikyuu!! is about teamwork, friendship and what
          pushing beyond your limits look like -- themes that can be applied to
          life as well

        <figcaption>
          Attack on Titan (Japanese: 進撃の巨人, Hepburn: Shingeki no Kyojin)
          The plot of Attack on Titan centers on a civilization inside three
          walls. According to the knowledge propagated locally, it is the last
          location where humans still live. Its inhabitants have been led to
          believe that over one hundred years ago, humanity was driven to the
          brink of extinction after the emergence of humanoid giants called
          Titans, who attack and eat humans on sight. The last remnants of
          humanity retreated behind three concentric walls and enjoyed nearly a
          century of peace. Within the walls, the thought of venturing outside
          is strongly frowned upon and discouraged. To combat Titans, the
          country's military employs Vertical Maneuvering Equipment, a set of
          waist-mounted grappling hooks and gas-powered propulsion enabling
          immense mobility in three dimensions.

        <figcaption>
          Yuri on Ice(Japanese: ユーリ!!! on ICE)) is about competitive figure
          skating, and so it has a heavy focus on strength, competition, and the
          pleasure of winning. As each skater performs their routine, viewers
          are treated to their innermost thoughts — their hopes, their dreams,
          their insecurities and reflection on their own movements.

        <figcaption>
          Fruits Basket (Japanese: フルーツバスケット, Hepburn: Furūtsu
          Basuketto), tells the story of Tohru Honda, an orphan girl who, after
          meeting Yuki, Kyo, and Shigure Sohma, learns that 13 members of the
          Sohma family are possessed by the animals of the Chinese zodiac and
          are cursed to turn into their animal forms when they are weak,
          stressed, or when they are embraced by anyone of the opposite sex that
          is not possessed by a spirit of the zodiac. As the series progresses,
          Tohru learns of the hardships and pain faced by the afflicted members
          of the Sohma family, and through her own generous and loving nature,
          helps heal their emotional wounds. As she learns more about Yuki, Kyo,
          and the rest of the mysterious Sohma family, Tohru also learns more
          about herself and how much others care for her.
